#PropL Experimental

After my work on [**PropL**](https://github.com/k0pernicus/PropL), my first supervisor proposed to me to create a software which analyse and compute the weight for each edge in a directed graph (Barabasi for example), based on some possible paths in this one.

This work has been made in *Python3.4* and *Rust* (experimental implementation).

The Musco model is available [here](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01120913).
